# C++ Game Engine
An game engine project written mainly in C/C++ using OpenGL/GLFW. Most things arent functional but starting to work on this again.

# Overview
## Renderer

2D Sprite rendering .

## Scripting

Uses LUA as a scripting language, very early in the implementation though.

## Physics

Simple 2d physics in place, works for sphere and box collision.

# Currently working on
